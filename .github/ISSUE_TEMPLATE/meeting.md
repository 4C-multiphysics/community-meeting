## Format of the Community Meeting

The 4C Community Meeting is open to everybody with an interest in 4C,
e.g. active @4C-multiphysics/developers but also all 4C users.

The planning of the meeting starts with a blank agenda, so the community can propose discussion topics up to two days before the meeting. Please add your items below. If no topics are submitted, the meeting will be canceled two days prior to the meeting


## Agenda
<!-- Team members can add items to the agenda before the meeting.          -->

<!-- If taken care of, mark action items as completed.                     -->
